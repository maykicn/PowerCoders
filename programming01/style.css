Exercise -1

1. Users give the numbers. I assume that 10 numbers as a list.
2. [2,8,0,3,1,-1,2,10,9,4]
3. I create one variable called "min" end I assumed that +infinity
4. I create new empty list called smallList to store small number
5. I start from next first number I assign first number to "min"
6. Then I compare min with the rest of the orgin list end samllList
7. If there is any number smaller than in the orgin list i assign that number to min 
8. At the same time i compare min with smallList if there is the same number in the smallList I stop that comparison and continue next number.
9. If smallList does not include min number I assign min to smallList.
10. Repeat 5-9 steps until origin list is empty. 



[2,8,0,3,1,-1,2,10,9,4]

min

Exercise - 2

1. Users give the numbers. I assume that 10 numbers as a list.
 [2,8,0,3,1,-1,2,10,9,4]
2. I create a variable called "sum" and assign 0 to "sum" 
3. Pick first element from list and add sum
4. Then remove first elemnt.
5. Repeat 3-4 steps until origin list is empty.
6. When there are no numbers left in the list write sum

Exercise - 3

1. INPUT first number
2. IF first input is not number
        WRITE  "This is not number"
   If first input is number 
        STORE as firstNumber
3.INPUT second number
4. IF second input is not number
        WRITE  "This is not number"
   If second input is number 
        STORE as secondNumber    
5.IF firstNumber is greater than secondNumber
        WRITE firstNumber-secondNumber
    IF secondNumber is greater than firstNumber
        WRITE  secondNumber-firstNumber
